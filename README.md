# E-Commerce-recommender-system-using-Collaborative-filtering-algorithm
## Project Overview
Aimed to enhance the user experience by implementation of a personalized product ranking system. A sophisticated machine learning model was developed that produced precise and relevant product rankings tailored to each user, considering factors like historical interactions, product trends, and user preferences. A collaborative filtering algorithm is utilised to provide accurate recommendations based on past user interactions. To address the cold start problem, a rank-based collaborative filtering algorithm is implemented for new users. This system seamlessly integrated into e-commerce websites, improving user satisfaction and potentially boosting company revenue. It catered to both regular users and newcomers effectively.
